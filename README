Install Fabric
--------------

# virtualenv --distribute --no-site-packages env
# pip install -E env -r requirements.txt
# source env/bin/activate

Prerequisites
-------------

1. An ssh key pushed to a server for a user
2. The user on the server must have NOPASSWD: ALL set in the /etc/sudoers file
   to ignore the password prompt for sudo.

Setting up SITE_NAME and SITE_EMAIL
-----------------------------------

edit fabfile.py change the SITE_NAME to a reasonable FQDN. In addition, make
sure to setup your email address in SITE_EMAIL.

Setup database.yml
------------------

The database.yml file needs to know your database password. The `fab deploy`
command will prompt you for a password. Make sure both of these passwords
match.

Run the deploy
--------------

# fab -H hostname -u user deploy

Connecting to your running gitorious
------------------------------------

1a. Setup DNS, or
1b. edit /etc/hosts and add the IP and FQDN to your hosts file
2. Browse to the FQDN

Setting up your first user
--------------------------

ssh to the server
cd /var/www/[SITE_NAME]/gitorious
env RAILS_ENV=production ruby script/create_admin
script/console
> user = User.first
> user.login = "username" # Change to your desired username
> user.activate
> user.accept_terms
> user.save

Email setup
-----------

Google for a howto on setting up email. Gitorious is setup to use a sendmail
compatible server... Postfix works.
